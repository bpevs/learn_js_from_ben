# Website Visuals

WIP

Basically, basic HTML and CSS stuff will go here.

Probably, Codecademy will suffice. I haven't used the site in a while, but their
tutorials in the past have been decent.

[Intro to HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)

[Intro to CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)

[Intro to Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)
lessons 1-9

Also, [NodeSchool's](https://nodeschool.io) `learnyouhtml` is probably pretty
decent.
