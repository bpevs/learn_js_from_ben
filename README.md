# Learn JS

I'm making this repository, since I seem to keep teaching people how to code.
This way I can keep common resources in the same place, which will be helpful.

The layout of this repository is basically:

- `lessons`: all the full lessons, in no particular order
- `tips`: various small hints and tips can be put here

## Setup

In order to follow this guide, you will need to setup a standardized development
environment. To help you set up a basic, but pretty standard environment, use
one of these:

- [Windows Setup](../tips/windows-dev-setup-guide.md)
- [Mac Setup](../tips/mac-dev-setup-guide.md)

### MDN Web Docs

Please bookmark [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and
[Node.js Docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). These are essentially your
dictionaries for this course. They will tell you what features are available to
use.
