# Dumb Vue

Stupid implementation of Vue.js This should be a good way to explore prototypes,
inheritence, and classes.

## Should be able to:

Create new Vue instance:

```js
new Vue(blahblahblah);
```

Create new Vue directive:

```js
Vue.directive("dumb-directive", blahblahblah);
```

Create new Vue component:

```js
Vue.component("dumb-component", blahblahblah);
```

Make them work in that order. No built-in components or directives. Do it
yourself dumbass. No virtual dom. Nobody needs that bullshit.
